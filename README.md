# Digilog

Digilog is a mindful gatekeeper for your screen time. It is designed to 
break the cycle of unconscious digital habits by requiring a single 
moment of intent before you engage with your device.

## 💡 The Core Concept: "Intent before Action"
Most screen-based distractions happen in the "gaps"—those seconds where 
you finish one task and impulsively open a new tab or app without thinking. 

Digilog fills that gap. It presents you with a simple question: 
**"What are you planning to do?"**

By naming your task, you transition from "autopilot mode" to "intentional 
mode." The running clock doesn't just show the time; it shows the exact 
moment you committed to your current focus.

## 🌀 How it works
1. **The Pulse**: The clock next to the input bar is always live. It 
   represents the "Now."
2. **The Declaration**: Before you start a new digital action, type it 
   into the bar (e.g., "Checking project emails" or "Researching 101").
3. **The Lock**: Pressing **Enter** captures that moment. The time is 
   frozen into your log, creating a permanent record of your intention.
4. **The Flow**: As your day progresses, you build a vertical history 
   of your digital life, making it easy to see where your focus went 
   and where it drifted.

## 🎯 Why use it?
- **Prevent Doom-scrolling**: If you have to type "Browsing social media," 
  you are much more likely to reconsider the choice.
- **Clarity**: High-contrast, distraction-free interface keeps you 
  focused on your words.
- **Privacy**: Your logs are yours alone. They exist only within your 
  browser session and never leave your screen.
